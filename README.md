# dataModel.GreenEnergy

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [GreenEnergyGenerator](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.GreenEnergy/blob/master/GreenEnergyGenerator/README.md). A generic generator station which can generate energy from green energy

- [GreenEnergyMeasurement](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.GreenEnergy/blob/master/GreenEnergyMeasurement/README.md). A instantaneous measure of power generation using green energy sources

- [PhotovoltaicDevice](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.GreenEnergy/blob/master/PhotovoltaicDevice/README.md). The Data Model is intended to describe the mechanical, electrical and thermal characteristics of photo-voltaic panels according to *STC - Standard Test Condition* and *NOCT - Normal Operating Cell Temperature*. *Remark* : This Data Model can be used directly as a main entity to describe the `Photovoltaic Device`  or as a sub-entity of the Data Model  `DEVICE` using a reference by the `refDevice` attribute. The measures performed for STC and NOCT are `Pmax` (Maximum Nominal Power), `Umpp` (Optimal operating voltage), `Impp` (Optimal Operating Current), `Uoc` (Open Circuit Voltage), `Isc` (Short Circuit Current). *Additional Information about Data Model:* This Data Model can be used directly as a main entity to describe the device [PHOTOVOLTAIC] or as a sub-entity of the Data Model [DEVICE] using a reference by the `refDevice` attribute.

- [PhotovoltaicMeasurement](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.GreenEnergy/blob/master/PhotovoltaicMeasurement/README.md). The Data Model is intended to measure the continuous power transferred by the photo-voltaic panel to an Inverter Device.
