    "description": "The Data Model is intended to describe the mechanical, electrical and thermal characteristics of photo-voltaic panels according to *STC - Standard Test Condition* and *NOCT - Normal Operating Cell Temperature*. *Remark* : This Data Model can be used directly as a main entity to describe the `Photovoltaic Device`  or as a sub-entity of the Data Model  `DEVICE` using a reference by the `refDevice` attribute. The measures performed for STC and NOCT are `Pmax` (Maximum Nominal Power), `Umpp` (Optimal operating voltage), `Impp` (Optimal Operating Current), `Uoc` (Open Circuit Voltage), `Isc` (Short Circuit Current). *Additional Information about Data Model:* This Data Model can be used directly as a main entity to describe the device [PHOTOVOLTAIC] or as a sub-entity of the Data Model [DEVICE] using a reference by the `refDevice` attribute."
